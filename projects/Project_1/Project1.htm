<li>It looks like a music magazine website. it has alot of big photos and articles. Feels modern and kind of like a newspaper format.</li>
<li>When you open the homepage there’s a top menu with links like “Reviews,” “News,” etc. Then is shows some featured stories and the rest of the is stacked down the page.</li>
<li>Mostly it makes sense but because there’s a lot of content it seems busy and sometimes you have to scroll a lot.</li>
<li>The photos look good and match the style. Layout is really clean.</li>
<li>On my computer the homepage loads fast, but it would depend on their server and also your internet connection.</li>
<li>yes the text is easy to read. it was a good size and mostly dark text on white background.</li>
<li>Yes there’s a navigation bar at the top with categories. Also a search icon. It stays similar across pages so thats nice.</li>
<li>I feel it was very consistent - white background, black or dark text. The styles of reviews/news/features are the same across pages so it feels like one site.</li>
<li>It works reasonably on phones and when you shrink the browser window. Menus collapse or turn into a different type of menu.</li>
<li>The way the site uses bold images and strong visuals is well done. Also the filtering by genre and sections is helpful.</li>
